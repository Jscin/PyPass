# PyPass
Simple password manager written in python using PyQt5




To install (Windows):

        Run the .exe file and extract to preferred location
        
It will create five new files: usernames.txt, passwords.txt, date-added.txt, login.txt, and key.key.

These are where the encrypted usernames/passwords are stored.

If you delete these files you will lose all your usernames/passwords.

Other important files are the key.key and login.txt files

The key.key file is to store your encryption key.

The login.txt file stores your login for the application.

The default login is Username: username Password: password.

You will be able to change this using a built in function in the application.

DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE AS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOG IN WITHOUT IT!
